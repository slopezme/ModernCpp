// Add a member function to the URL class which returns the URL as an std::string 
// (e.g. "http://example.com/index.html")

// Write a class which uses an STL container to store objects of your URL class. 
// New objects are added at the front of the container.

// Only add a URL object if the URL is not already in the history. 
// If the URL is already present, move it to the front of the container.

// Write a program to test your class. Check that your program compiles and runs correctly.
